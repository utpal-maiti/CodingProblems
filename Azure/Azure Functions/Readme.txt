Azure Functions offers several types of functions, each designed for different purposes. Here are the main types:
### 1. **HTTP Trigger Functions**
These functions respond to HTTP requests. They are commonly used to build RESTful APIs.
### 2. **Timer Trigger Functions**
These functions run on a schedule. You can use them to perform tasks at regular intervals, such as daily clean-up jobs or periodic data processing.
### 3. **Blob Trigger Functions**
These functions are triggered by events in Azure Blob Storage, such as when a new file is uploaded.
### 4. **Queue Trigger Functions**
These functions are triggered by messages in Azure Queue Storage. They are useful for processing tasks asynchronously.
### 5. **Event Hub Trigger Functions**
These functions respond to events in Azure Event Hubs, making them suitable for real-time data processing.
### 6. **Cosmos DB Trigger Functions**
These functions are triggered by changes in Azure Cosmos DB. They are useful for responding to database operations.
### 7. **Durable Functions**
Durable Functions are an extension of Azure Functions that enable stateful orchestration. They include:
- **Orchestrator Functions**: Define the workflow and order of execution.
- **Activity Functions**: Perform individual tasks within the workflow.
- **Entity Functions**: Manage stateful entities.
- **Client Functions**: Interact with durable functions.
### 8. **Custom Trigger Functions**
You can also create custom triggers to respond to events from other Azure services or custom applications.
Each type of function serves a specific purpose and can be used to build scalable, event-driven applications.
